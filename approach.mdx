# Information Architecture Approach

This documentation now prioritizes the most common journeys first while keeping versioning and language choices obvious and low-friction.

## Decision-Making Process

- **Primary split by language**: Tabs separate English and French to reduce cognitive load and prevent mixed-language navigation.
- **Within each language, v2 first**: Most users want the latest capabilities, so v2 content is the default path.
- **Legacy v1 grouped**: v1 remains fully accessible but visually separated to set expectations.
- **Consistent group labels**: Repeated group names across languages improve scanning and make the structure easier to learn.

## UX Improvements

- **Start Here** highlights the entry path (overview, onboarding, advanced usage).
- **Guides** hold day-to-day workflows and feature deep dives.
- **Reference** collects API, changelog, and troubleshooting in one predictable place.
- **Legacy v1** is complete, but intentionally grouped to reduce accidental navigation.

## Trade-Offs Considered

- **Tabs vs. single tree**: Tabs add one extra click, but they reduce clutter and language confusion for global users.
- **v2-first vs. version parity**: Prioritizing v2 helps most users, while v1 remains discoverable for maintenance teams.

## Component Choices (v2 Content)

- **Tabs**: Used to compare workflows (setup paths, plan summaries, API styles).
- **Columns + Cards**: Used for fast scanning of feature categories and key updates.
- **Callouts (Note/Warning/Tip)**: Used to surface critical guidance without interrupting flow.
- **CodeGroup**: Used to show equivalent API usage across languages.

## Scalability

This structure scales in three dimensions:

- **New languages**: Add a new tab per locale with the same group layout.
- **New versions**: Add a new group (e.g., "v3") without disturbing existing structure.
- **New product areas**: Add a new group under Guides or Reference without changing the entry path.
